CryptoPriceAlert - Cryptocurrency price monitor
================

![CryptoPriceAlert](https://www.immortaltools.com/cryptopricealert/img/cryptopricealertfancy.jpg "Preview")

This is a windows program for cryptocurrency price alerts. First release is simple and only do price updates for DogeCoin.

With this program you dont have to manually look at the markets 24/7 to see the price. 
Instead you will have a floating window on the desktop on top of other windows constantly showing you the current price.

Now you can do other things than refreshing an exchange 24/7, and still be updated on the price!

* Gets the price for Dogecoin in BTC/DOGE from coinmarketcap
* Price updates in a small window that is on top of other windows
* Window is movable and position is saved
* Price is updated every 60 second
* Text is green if positive, red if negative, blue if no change
* Could not get price: text "ERROR" in red text color
* Dynamic task tray icons, green up arrow and red down arrow
* Option for transparency and click through
* Automatic notifications of newer version
* Menu in task tray for size, transparency, click through, about and exit
